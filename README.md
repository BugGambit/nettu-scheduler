## Todos

- error handling: https://auth0.com/blog/build-an-api-in-rust-with-jwt-authentication-using-actix-web/
- https://developer.makeplans.net/#services
- frontend for booking
  - admin portal for external application
  - callback for connecting to google calendar and outlook calendar


## backlog

- smarter mongodb schema
- More api tests for [calendarevent, booking]
- think about how to do auth (nettu ee will likely also use this and maybe nettmeet)
  - should it be just microservice for nettu to start with ? (public / private cert jwt, check google)
  - same as nettu meeting with external api calling endpoints ?
  - both
